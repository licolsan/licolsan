# 🏁 Competitions

I gained some prizes when I was at my university. It makes my student's life more enjoyable

- 1st   - [Subject insurance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wZhKpykA40i22iiJqQasA9fLFra-HQY3/view?usp=sharing)

    Our team had an idea to develop a smart contract (on Ethereum blockchain) to store and use insurance scores when a student failed to pass a subject. With insurance scores, the student can use it as a subject fee to relearn the subject.

- 3rd - [Blarking - blockchain for parking](https://www.facebook.com/intek.edu.vn/posts/2311022035840186)

    Another idea of my team when joining this competition is using blockchain and its smart contract as a tracking service for car parking. It might reduce traffic jams, and helps people reduce their time when choosing a place to park.
