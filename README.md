# üõ† Technical skills

### Docker Swarm

Docker swarm is an orchestration tool that its configure is simple. I used to research orchestration tools, and I choose swarm to start learning. Although swam still has limitations, and sometimes faults, I think it is good enough for my beginning steps on DevOps journey.

### Ansible

Ansible allows me to run a sequence of commands to one or multiple computers. I used to play with playbooks to install dependency packages on a computer before joining it to a cluster. It saves time for me very much because I do not have to type commands line by line manually.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool that helps us to set up virtual machines fastly in the local computer so that we can do experiment with other orchestration and automation technologies locally. I used Vagrant to set up my own docker swarm cluster. It saves time for me on the way of learning docker swarm & ansible.

# üèÅ Competitions

I gained some prizes when I was at my university. It makes my student's life more enjoyable

- 1st   - [Subject insurance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wZhKpykA40i22iiJqQasA9fLFra-HQY3/view?usp=sharing)

    Our team had an idea to develop a smart contract (on Ethereum blockchain) to store and use insurance scores when a student failed to pass a subject. With insurance scores, the student can use it as a subject fee to relearn the subject.

- 3rd - [Blarking - blockchain for parking](https://www.facebook.com/intek.edu.vn/posts/2311022035840186)

    Another idea of my team when joining this competition is using blockchain and its smart contract as a tracking service for car parking. It might reduce traffic jams, and helps people reduce their time when choosing a place to park.
